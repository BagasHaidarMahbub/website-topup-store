**Title:** Section 1 – Guidelines for Condition Assessment Program

**Subtitle:** General

**Content:**
1. These Guidelines define the conditions under which a Condition Assessment Program (CAP) will be performed.
2. The Condition Assessment Program (CAP) is an expertise about the condition of a vessel, independent and separate from the system of classification. The Rules for Classification and Surveys, Volume I, are not applicable except for references made in these Guidelines.
3. If specifically ordered, Biro Klasifikasi Indonesia (BKI) conducts a Condition Assessment Program (CAP) on board ships independently of classification surveys. However, it is advisable to carry CAP surveys concurrently with class renewal survey, class intermediate survey, or CAS survey, if applicable. This will help to avoid extra work and costs with regard to both surveys and repairs.

**Title:** Section 1 – Guidelines for Condition Assessment Program

**Subtitle:** Aim

**Content:**
A Condition Assessment Program (CAP) aims to have the vessel judged based on the actual condition onboard rather than the ship’s age. This process determines and assesses the actual technical condition of hull, machinery, and electrical installation included with cargo handling systems at a given point in time by surveys and investigations. Under certain conditions, prospects on structural risks will be given.

**Title:** Section 1 – Guidelines for Condition Assessment Program

**Subtitle:** Prerequisites

**Content:**
1. The ship needs to be built under the supervision of BKI or any classification society or any BKI recognized organization. BKI Head Office will carry out Condition Assessment Program (CAP).
2. The Condition Assessment Program (CAP), including repairs and remedies, are to be completed within a 6-month period at the time of the initial CAP surveys.
3. Before the Condition Assessment Program (CAP) surveys start, the owner should propose suitable objectives regarding the overall and detail of CAP rating. Such a decision should be based on stated or implied requirements from potential charterers, the current condition of the ship, and the time/money intended to be invested towards possible upgrading of the ship.
4. According to the CAP contract, the owner is advised to notify BKI at least 2 (two) months before the requested commencement of the CAP inspection and shall provide BKI with all necessary information for planning and arranging the inspection. Early notification is important for BKI to prepare for inspection and to carry out CAP analysis before the requested CAP inspection. CAP is a specialized service with a limited number of qualified surveyors available and early notification is also required to arrange the manning of the projects.

  - Between deck and bottom area every longitudinal and girder shall be measured on the web and flange and every plate strake at least one point per plate.

4. All tanks in the cargo area are to be measured in at least three transverse web frame rings for each tank, normally located in the forward, middle, and aft parts of the tank. Measurements in two transverse web frame rings are sufficient for tanks of less than 15 meters in length. All structures in and adjacent to these web frame rings are to be measured, including:
  - Longitudinals and other stiffeners with one representative measurement on both web and flange.
  - Shipside (outside wind and water strakes) and longitudinal bulkhead plates (2 points per plate strake).
  - Stringer platforms with associated structure (2 points per plate).
  - Transverse bulkheads including swash bulkheads with associated structure (plates and stiffeners at three horizontal levels).
  - Web frames with flanges, stiffeners, and brackets.

**Title:** Section 2 – CAP Thickness Measurement Specification

**Subtitle:** Reduced Extent of Measurements

**Content:**
1. The extent of measurements in shell plating (ref. Section C.2) and in three transverse sections in the cargo area (ref. Section C.3), including three transverse belts for each tank (ref. Section C.4), is not to be reduced.

2. The number of readings may only be reduced if the structure in question is:
- Made of solid stainless steel, or
- Coated with original coating still intact on both sides of the structure, or
- Located within fuel or cargo tank(s)
- Representative thickness measurements reveal no or negligible steel loss, well within the requirements for CAP 1 (33% of allowable margin). The representative measurements are to be taken in areas expected to represent worst-case corrosion.
